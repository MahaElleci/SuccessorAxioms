# SuccessorAxioms 

The galaxy is in the midst of a civil war. Spies for the Rebel Alliance have stolen plans from the Death Star; 
a heavily armed space station capable of destroying an entire planet. Unfortunately, the rebels’ ship was soon captured by the 
Death Star’s imperial forces guarding the Death Star. Before the rebels were captured, they were able to hide the plans in the memory 
of a droid called R2-D2. It is R2-D2’s mission to try escaping its prison in the Death Star and deliver
the stolen plans to the rebels’ planet to help destroy the Death Star once and for all. 

In this project, a logic-based agent was designed and implemented using the general search algorithim. 
A logic-based agent operates by storing sentences about the world in its knowledge base, 
using an inference mechanism to infer new sentences, and using these sentences to decide which action to take. 
This project generates the succesor state axioms
